0  This category includes emissions from upstream purchasing of goods and\nservices, including direct and indirect goods. Microsoft has been using\nan ISO 14040/ISO 14044 compliant life cycle assessment (LCA) approach\nfor many years to track the emissions associated with its devices. In FY23,\nMicrosoft started using its LCAs to calculate the portion of emissions\nassociated with the manufacture of devices Microsoft sold during the\nreporting year including Xbox devices, Surface devices, HoloLens,\nkeyboards, mice, and other peripherals. Microsoft utilized Makersite and\ninternal software engineering teams in order to automate and scale the\nmodeling of complex electronic products. To ensure a more supply chain\nspecific accounting process, the system analyzes the bill of materials\nand material composition from full material declarations collected from\nsuppliers, resulting in LCA-based emissions that have increased accuracy,\ntransparency, and representativeness. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth\nAssessment Report (AR4), 100-year average. For the rest of the emissions,\nMicrosoft requests carbon emissions data from its suppliers and uses\ntheir responses to determine Scope 1, Scope 2, and upstream Scope 3\nemission factors (mtCO e/$ revenue). The latest available responses are\n2\nused, so this report’s inventory considers 2023 submissions (that is, 2022\ndata). Microsoft estimates emissions for suppliers who submitted data by\nmultiplying their response-derived factor by the annual spend with the\nsupplier. All other spend is mapped to corresponding industry sectors\nand then multiplied by cradle-to-gate emission factors by sector from UK\nDefra’s “UK Defra, Table 13 — Indirect emissions from the supply chain.\nMarch 2014”—updated per the latest inflation and currency conversion\nrates. Corporate-wide expense data for all company divisions is obtained\nfrom the finance department. Activities already included in Scope 1 and\nScope 2 (such as electricity purchases) and other Scope 3 categories\n(such as capital goods) were removed to prevent double counting.\nGlobal warming potentials (GWP) values are derived from the underlying\nsupplier responses and Defra data sources.  51%"

Fuel- and energy-related\nactivities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include three emission sources.\nFirst, upstream emissions of purchased electricity were calculated by\nmultiplying electricity use by emission factors from life cycle analysis tools\nfor the United States and UK Defra 2015 Guidelines for non-US countries.\nWhen calculating the market-based approach and including the impact\nfrom purchased renewable electricity, the upstream emissions associated\nwith fuel are zero. Second, fuel consumption was multiplied by emission\nfactors from the GREET and Ecoinvent life cycle analysis tools. And third,\ntransmission and distribution (T&D) losses (by energy use type) were\nmultiplied by loss percentages from the EPA’s eGRID2020 database for the\nUnited States and emission factors from IEA (2022) emission factors for\nother countries.

0  This category includes emissions from upstream transportation of goods,\nincluding all transportation of goods that Microsoft finances. In FY23,\nMicrosoft started calculating emissions for this category following the\nGlobal Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework using data inputs\nfrom Microsoft’s fourth-party logistics service provider, TMC. Our Devices\nbusiness group applies this calculation considering the shipment weight,\ndistance traveled, and the corresponding well-to-wheel (WTW) fuel\nemission factor appropriate for each mode or vehicle type. In addition\nto these inputs, our Cloud business group uses the EcoTransIT tool\nwhich identifies the mode of transportation on each leg by breaking\ndown the route through milestones, and incorporates more granular\nlocation data, equipment data, and WTW emissions factors. For the\nrest of the emissions, Microsoft requests carbon emissions data from\nits suppliers and uses their responses to determine Scope 1, Scope 2,\nand upstream Scope 3 emission factors (mtCO e/$ revenue). The latest\n2\navailable responses are used, so this report’s inventory considers 2023\nsubmissions (that is, 2022 data). Microsoft estimates emissions for\nsuppliers who submitted data by multiplying their response-derived\nfactor by the annual spend with the supplier. All other spend is mapped\nto corresponding industry sectors and then multiplied by cradle-to-\ngate emission factors by sector from UK Defra’s “UK Defra, Table 13\n— Indirect emissions from the supply chain. March 2014”—updated\nper the latest inflation and currency conversion rates. Corporate-wide\nexpense data for all company divisions is obtained from the finance\ndepartment. Spend data associated with our upstream transportation and\ndistribution activities is then isolated within the corporate spend report.\nGWP values are derived from the underlying supplier responses and Defra\ndata sources.  97%

0  This category includes the emissions of all Surface and Xbox devices\nactive during the reporting year, using telemetry-based methodology\nto account for their electricity usage. Telemetry-based measurements\nare used in addition to telemetry informed extrapolations to produce\nregional electricity and emissions associated to the use of devices in\nscope. For Xbox devices, telemetry data is gathered for all units still in\nuse in relation to console mode, which is then multiplied by average\npower coefficients to calculate electricity use. For Surface devices, energy\ntelemetry data is gathered from a representative sample of devices\nthat are grouped based on the device model and location and then the\naverage energy per device sampled is extrapolated to the respective\nfull daily active device population group based on a rolling seven-day\naverage. Emissions values from HoloLens, keyboards, mice, and other\nperipherals currently fall under our significance threshold and are not\nincluded. Emissions from third-party devices running Microsoft software\nare currently outside of the scope of our carbon commitments and\ntherefore not included. Electricity usage is estimated by country and\ncountry average emission factors from the same sources highlighted for\nScope 2 are used to estimate emissions.

Microsoft has been\nusing an ISO 14040/ISO 14044 compliant life cycle assessment (LCA)\napproach for many years to track the end-of-life emissions for its devices.\nTo generate an estimate for this category, the model assumes materials\nfrom devices are recycled, landfilled, or incinerated at the end of their\nuseful life using material specific European collection and disposition rates\nfor electronic devices. In FY23, Microsoft revised its LCA process to use\nMakersite and internal software engineering teams in order to automate\nand scale the modeling of complex electronic products.

0  Emissions associated with sublets are calculated using the intensities\nderived from data collected for the primary leased space (for example,\nkilowatt-hours/square foot (kWh/sf)) and prorated for the square\nfootage of the sublet space. In this way, it is assumed that the emissions\nintensities of the leased spaces are the same as the overall buildings in\nwhich they reside. Estimated refrigerants are calculated using the same\nmethodology and intensity as used to calculate refrigerant intensities\nfor assets occupied by Microsoft. Electricity emission factors used are\nthose appropriate to each location, as utilized in our Scope 1 and Scope\n2 location-based inventory.
