## Running the App

To set up a local instance of the app, follow these instructions carefully to ensure the environment is configured correctly. A local instance runs on your personal computer, allowing you to interact with the app in isolation. 

A deployed version of the app would be located in a remote server where it can be accessed by the public.

### Prerequisites

- **Python Environment:** Create a virtual environment using Python 3.10.0 or higher. This ensures that your local environment is isolated and does not interfere with other projects.
  
- **Dependencies:** Install the necessary dependencies by running the command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  This will install all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file, ensuring that your app has all the necessary libraries to run smoothly.
  ```bash
  # add additional software dependencies
  ```
