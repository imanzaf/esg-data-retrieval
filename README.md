## Running the App

To set up a local instance of the app, follow these instructions carefully to ensure the environment is configured correctly. A local instance runs on your personal computer, allowing you to interact with the app in isolation.

### Prerequisites

- **Python Environment:** Create a virtual environment using Python 3.10.0 or higher. This ensures that your local environment is isolated and does not interfere with other projects.
  
- **Dependencies:** Install the necessary dependencies by running the command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  This will install all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file, ensuring that your app has all the necessary libraries to run smoothly.

- **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store sensitive information such as API keys and other configuration settings. You can use the `.env.template` file as a starting point and fill in the necessary values.

### Invoking the App
To start the app, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    ```
