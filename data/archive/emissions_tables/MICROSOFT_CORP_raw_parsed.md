| Capital Goods                                                           | This category includes emissions from upstream purchasing of capital  goods, including server equipment and other long-term assets.  Microsoft requests carbon emissions data from its suppliers and uses  their responses to determine Scope 1, Scope 2, and upstream Scope 3  emission factors (tCO2e/$ revenue). The latest available responses are  used, so this report's inventory considers 2023 submissions (that is, 2022  data). Microsoft estimates emissions for suppliers who submitted data by  multiplying their response-derived factor by the annual spend with the  supplier. All other spend is mapped to corresponding industry sectors  and then multiplied by cradle-to-gate emission factors by sector from  UK Defra's "UK Defra, Table 13 - Indirect emissions from the supply chain.  March 2014"-updated per the latest inflation and currency conversion  rates. Corporate-wide expense data for all company divisions is obtained  from the finance department. Activities already included in Scope 1 and  Scope 2 (such as electricity purchases) and other Scope 3 categories  (such as purchased goods and services) were removed to prevent double  counting. GWP values are derived from the underlying supplier responses  and Defra data sources. | 70%                                                          |
| Fuel- and  Energy  Related  Activities (not  included in  Scope 1 or 2) | Starting in FY23, Microsoft reports this category using a market-based  approach only, which has been the approach used to track progress  against our carbon negative commitment. Fuel- and energy-related  activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include three emission sources.  First, upstream emissions of purchased electricity were calculated by  multiplying electricity use by emission factors from life cycle analysis tools  for the United States and UK Defra 2015 Guidelines for non-US countries.  When calculating the market-based approach and including the impact  from purchased renewable electricity, the upstream emissions associated  with fuel are zero. Second, fuel consumption was multiplied by emission  factors from the GREET and Ecoinvent life cycle analysis tools. And third,  transmission and distribution (T&D) losses (by energy use type) were  multiplied by loss percentages from the EPA's eGRID2020 database for the  United States and emission factors from IEA (2022) emission factors for  other countries. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),                                                                                                                                                           | 96%                                                          |

| Upstream  Transportation  and  Distribution | This category includes emissions from upstream transportation of goods,  including all transportation of goods that Microsoft finances. In FY23,  Microsoft started calculating emissions for this category following the  Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework using data inputs  from Microsoft's fourth-party logistics service provider, TMC. Our Devices  business group applies this calculation considering the shipment weight,  distance traveled, and the corresponding well-to-wheel (WTW) fuel  emission factor appropriate for each mode or vehicle type. In addition  to these inputs, our Cloud business group uses the EcoTransIT tool  which identifies the mode of transportation on each leg by breaking  down the route through milestones, and incorporates more granular  location data, equipment data, and WTW emissions factors. For the  rest of the emissions, Microsoft requests carbon emissions data from  its suppliers and uses their responses to determine Scope 1, Scope 2,  and upstream Scope 3 emission factors (mtCO2e/$ revenue). The latest  available responses are used, so this report's inventory considers 2023  submissions (that is, 2022 data). Microsoft estimates emissions for  suppliers who submitted data by multiplying their response-derived  factor by the annual spend with the supplier. All other spend is mapped  to corresponding industry sectors and then multiplied by cradle-to  gate emission factors by sector from UK Defra's "UK Defra, Table 13 | 97%                                                          |
| Waste  Generated in  Operations             | The waste figure represents emissions from waste disposed via landfilling,  incineration, recycling, and compost. Emissions from waste are calculated  using methodologies and emission factors from the EPA's Waste  Reduction Model (WARM), version 15. This model uses waste mass as the  data input and bases its emissions calculations on a life cycle analysis,  including emissions from the long-term decomposition of waste in a  landfill or from upstream sources/sinks. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth  Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 64%                                                          |
