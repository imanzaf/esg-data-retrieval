0,Downstream   Leased Assets,"Emissions associated with sublets are calculated using the intensities  derived from data collected for the primary leased space (for example,  kilowatt-hours/square foot (kWh/sf)) and prorated for the square  footage of the sublet space. In this way, it is assumed that the emissions  intensities of the leased spaces are the same as the overall buildings in  which they reside. Estimated refrigerants are calculated using the same  methodology and intensity as used to calculate refrigerant intensities  for assets occupied by Microsoft. Electricity emission factors used are  those appropriate to each location, as utilized in our Scope 1 and Scope  2 location-based inventory. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment  Report (AR4), 100-year average.",85%
