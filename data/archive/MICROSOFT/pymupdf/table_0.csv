Gross emissions is calculated by multiplying a) the direct
use-phase energy, which is derived from emissions
gathered by the Company using telemetry data and
calculations used to measure energy usage from Xbox
consoles and Surface devices sold by Microsoft at any
point in time since product launch and which are still in
use by end users during the fiscal year being reported on
and b) location-based emissions factors.
For purposes of this metric, renewable electricity is
defined as the purchase of contractual instruments that
meet the “quality criteria” according to table 7.1 in the GHG
Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.
Microsoft shall disclose:
a. A description of the types and sources of data,
including telemetry activity data, emission factors,
and GWP (global warming potentials) values, used
