0,"This category includes the emissions of all Surface and Xbox devices
active during the reporting year, using telemetry-based methodology
to account for their electricity usage. Telemetry-based measurements
are used in addition to telemetry informed extrapolations to produce
regional electricity and emissions associated to the use of devices in
scope. For Xbox devices, telemetry data is gathered for all units still in
use in relation to console mode, which is then multiplied by average
power coefficients to calculate electricity use. For Surface devices, energy
telemetry data is gathered from a representative sample of devices
that are grouped based on the device model and location and then the
average energy per device sampled is extrapolated to the respective
full daily active device population group based on a rolling seven-day
average. Emissions values from HoloLens, keyboards, mice, and other
peripherals currently fall under our significance threshold and are not
included. Emissions from third-party devices running Microsoft software
are currently outside of the scope of our carbon commitments and
therefore not included. Electricity usage is estimated by country and
country average emission factors from the same sources highlighted for
Scope 2 are used to estimate emissions. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average.",0%
1,"Included in this category is the end-of-life treatment of devices Microsoft
sold during the reporting year including Xbox devices, Surface devices,
HoloLens, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals. Microsoft has been
using an ISO 14040/ISO 14044 compliant life cycle assessment (LCA)
approach for many years to track the end-of-life emissions for its devices.
To generate an estimate for this category, the model assumes materials
from devices are recycled, landfilled, or incinerated at the end of their
useful life using material specific European collection and disposition rates
for electronic devices. In FY23, Microsoft revised its LCA process to use
Makersite and internal software engineering teams in order to automate
and scale the modeling of complex electronic products. GWPs are from
the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average.",0%
