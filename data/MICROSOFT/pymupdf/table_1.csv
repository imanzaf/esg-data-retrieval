party assurance for the most
recent year (FY23) prior to the
issuance of the Environmental
Data Fact Sheet. The limited
assurance reviews performed by
Deloitte & Touche LLP in FY21
and FY22 do not contemplate
the revisions to the prior year
metrics and therefore Deloitte

assurance related to the revisions
consistent with our policies
disclosed in Section 1.8"
