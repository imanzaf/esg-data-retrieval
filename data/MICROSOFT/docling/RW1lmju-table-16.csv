,Scope  3 category,Emissions calculation methodology,Percentage  of emissions  calculated  using supplier  data
0,Capital Goods,"This category includes emissions from upstream purchasing of capital  goods, including server equipment and other long-term assets.  Microsoft requests carbon emissions data from its suppliers and uses  their responses to determine Scope 1, Scope 2, and upstream Scope 3  emission factors (tCO2e/$ revenue). The latest available responses are  used, so this report's inventory considers 2023 submissions (that is, 2022  data). Microsoft estimates emissions for suppliers who submitted data by  multiplying their response-derived factor by the annual spend with the  supplier. All other spend is mapped to corresponding industry sectors  and then multiplied by cradle-to-gate emission factors by sector from  UK Defra's ""UK Defra, Table 13 - Indirect emissions from the supply chain.  March 2014""-updated per the latest inflation and currency conversion  rates. Corporate-wide expense data for all company divisions is obtained  from the finance department. Activities already included in Scope 1 and  Scope 2 (such as electricity purchases) and other Scope 3 categories  (such as purchased goods and services) were removed to prevent double  counting. GWP values are derived from the underlying supplier responses  and Defra data sources.",70%
1,Fuel- and  Energy- Related  Activities (not  included in  Scope 1 or 2),"Starting in FY23, Microsoft reports this category using a market-based  approach only, which has been the approach used to track progress  against our carbon negative commitment. Fuel- and energy-related  activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include three emission sources.  First, upstream emissions of purchased electricity were calculated by  multiplying electricity use by emission factors from life cycle analysis tools  for the United States and UK Defra 2015 Guidelines for non-US countries.  When calculating the market-based approach and including the impact  from purchased renewable electricity, the upstream emissions associated  with fuel are zero. Second, fuel consumption was multiplied by emission  factors from the GREET and Ecoinvent life cycle analysis tools. And third,  transmission and distribution (T&D) losses (by energy use type) were  multiplied by loss percentages from the EPA's eGRID2020 database for the  United States and emission factors from IEA (2022) emission factors for  other countries. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),  100-year average.",96%
