,Scope  3 category,Emissions calculation methodology,Percentage  of emissions  calculated  using supplier  data
0,Upstream  Leased Assets,Not relevant. Microsoft includes leased assets in our Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions reporting boundary.,-
1,Downstream  Transportation  and  Distribution,"Included in this category are the emissions from transporting and  warehousing of devices Microsoft sold (including Xbox devices, Surface  devices, HoloLens, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals) from retail  distribution centers to retailers and between retail outlets and customers.  Calculations are based on internal Microsoft sales data and use standard  assumptions of distance between retailers and their distribution centers  and warehouse floorspace from an MWPVL International analysis  of Walmart's distribution center network. Assumptions about the  energy intensity of warehouses come from the US Energy Information  Administration (EIA)'s Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey  (2012). All transportation data is kept consistent with the Global Logistics  Emissions Council Framework for Logistics Emissions Accounting and  Reporting, Version 2.0. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment  Report (AR4), 100-year average.",0%
2,Processing of  Sold Products,Not relevant. Microsoft did not have any physical intermediate products,-
3,Use of Sold  Products,"in the years reported.  Included in this category is the lifetime electricity use of devices Microsoft  sold including Xbox devices, Surface devices, HoloLens, keyboards, mice,  and other peripherals. Lifetime electricity use per device is calculated  based on standard product-use assumptions as included in our ISO  14040- and ISO 14044-compliant life cycle analyses. Calculations include  energy use assumptions that are derived from various guidance  documents, studies, or telemetry data. Assumptions on total lifetime  expected use (years) are used. Sales geography for the products sold  is used to determine the electricity emission factor used to calculate  emissions. Emissions from third-party devices running Microsoft software  are currently outside of the scope of our carbon commitments and  therefore not included. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment  Report (AR4), 100-year average.",0%
