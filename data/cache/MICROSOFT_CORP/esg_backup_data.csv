Fuel- and energy-related  activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include three emission sources.  First, upstream emissions of purchased electricity were calculated by  multiplying electricity use by emission factors from life cycle analysis tools  for the United States and UK Defra 2015 Guidelines for non-US countries.  When calculating the market-based approach and including the impact  from purchased renewable electricity, the upstream emissions associated  with fuel are zero. Second, fuel consumption was multiplied by emission  factors from the GREET and Ecoinvent life cycle analysis tools. And third,  transmission and distribution (T&D) losses (by energy use type) were  multiplied by loss percentages from the EPA's eGRID2020 database for the  United States and emission factors from IEA (2022) emission factors for  other countries. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),",96%,
