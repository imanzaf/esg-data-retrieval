0,Upstream   Transportation   and  Distribution,"This category includes emissions from upstream transportation of goods,  including all transportation of goods that Microsoft finances. In FY23,  Microsoft started calculating emissions for this category following the  Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework using data inputs  from Microsoft's fourth-party logistics service provider, TMC. Our Devices  business group applies this calculation considering the shipment weight,  distance traveled, and the corresponding well-to-wheel (WTW) fuel  emission factor appropriate for each mode or vehicle type. In addition  to these inputs, our Cloud business group uses the EcoTransIT tool  which identifies the mode of transportation on each leg by breaking  down the route through milestones, and incorporates more granular  location data, equipment data, and WTW emissions factors. For the  rest of the emissions, Microsoft requests carbon emissions data from  its suppliers and uses their responses to determine Scope 1, Scope 2,  and upstream Scope 3 emission factors (mtCO2e/$ revenue). The latest  available responses are used, so this report's inventory considers 2023  submissions (that is, 2022 data). Microsoft estimates emissions for  suppliers who submitted data by multiplying their response-derived  factor by the annual spend with the supplier. All other spend is mapped  to corresponding industry sectors and then multiplied by cradle-to- gate emission factors by sector from UK Defra's 'UK Defra, Table 13",97%
1,Waste   Generated in  Operations,"The waste figure represents emissions from waste disposed via landfilling,  incineration, recycling, and compost. Emissions from waste are calculated  using methodologies and emission factors from the EPA's Waste  Reduction Model (WARM), version 15. This model uses waste mass as the  data input and bases its emissions calculations on a life cycle analysis,  including emissions from the long-term decomposition of waste in a  landfill or from upstream sources/sinks. GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth  Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average.",64%
